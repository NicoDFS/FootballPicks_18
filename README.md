<h2>Borman Pickem Challenge: Upset Edition</h2>

The game is back for the 2018 season! Major improvments have been made and im exciting to share for anyone who may have participated in the past.

The goal of the game is to <i>correctly pick the winner for each machup everyweek throughout the 17 week season</i>. The minimun points rewarded will be 1 point. Howver, new this year picking an upset and that team winnig will yield 3 points. A healthy 2 more than just going along with everyone else. An upset is determined by percentage dealing with users on the site and has nothing to do with point spread. 

<b>"Weekly winners"</b> will be highlighted on the side of the screen on desktops/laptops and phones will display them at the bottom after each potential selection. If you qualify and are the sole winner of the week. I will give an Amazon giftcard as a prize with a $10 value.  <br><br>
<b>"Grand Champion"</b> Afther the last game has been played and the points awarded for week 17, the overall champion will be crowned and awarded a $25 amazon giftcaard as a thank you for playing. 



<h2><b>New Features</b></h2> 
<b>Saveless picking!</b>  If you are a returning user, the pain of making picks and then hitting the save button has been eliminated. The info becomes persistant the momeent you touch a team. A request is made, I run my checks and get the exact game you are picking along with what team you are rolling with. I save the info and return the new updated percentaages along with adjusting visually who has actively been picked. <br>
<b>Stay logged in!</b> Save a lot of time and use the same device or method of making your weekly picks. The info is stored in the form of cookies and will not expire unless told to by the process of creating a new user, hitting the log out link, or by clearing the cached data/cookies in the browser settings. The animation of making picks will not occur if a user is not logging in. If you attempt to make your weekly selection, and nothing is happing, make sure you are loggin in at the top.

<h3><b>Rules</b></h3> 
The only rules for this this game are as followed: <br> 1) Changing a user pick after the corresponding game has been played is not allowed and will be unavailable. The site wont allow for this. However its just me coding this game so im sure they are precautions I didnt take to fully prevent this. There is a timpstamp of each pick though so I will know. 
<br>2) Upset Picks have a dynamic feel and are always changing their status. If you pick a game based on a current upsety possibility, just know they are only an upset if they enter the lockout process as one. For instance, you pick a team that hovers around the 30 percent picked line with a day to go. The vast majority make the same pick and the percentages even out to about 45% and 55%. This game no longer has a 3 point potential payout. 

<h4>Thank you for playing</h4><h7>Any recommendations and feedback is welcome</h7>
